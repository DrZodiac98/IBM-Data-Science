# # DATA SCIENCE TOOLS AND ECOSYSTEM

# In this notebook, we will go through the fundamentals of data science tools that are popular 

# Three popular languages that are used in data science are:
#   1. Python
#   2. SQL
#   3. R

# Some of the popular data science libraries are:
#  1. Pandas
#  2. NumPy
#  3. sciKit-learn
#  4. Keras
#  5. PyTorch
#  

# |Data science tools|
# |---------|
# | RStudio |
# | Apache Spark |
# | TensorFlow |

# Below are few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in python

# In[2]:


51*62


# In[7]:


(1+65)-1


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

# In[8]:


(3*4)+5


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

# In[10]:


mins = 200
hours = mins/60
print(hours)


# ## Objectives:

# - List popular libraries
# - List Popular ds languages
# - Convert minutes to hours
# - Evaluate arithmetic expressions
